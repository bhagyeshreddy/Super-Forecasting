# Super-Forecasting
This repository contains project "Super Forecasting" where we try to answer some global level questions in different fields using Bayesian Prior.
# Super Forecasting Project

## Overview
This project explores three critical forecasting questions:
1. **Who will win the 2024 Men's T20 Cricket World Cup?**
2. **What will China's GDP growth rate be for Q3 2024?**
3. **What percentage of US energy will come from solar power in 2025?**

The analysis employs statistical modeling, historical trends, and expert inputs to derive probability-based predictions for each scenario. Key methodologies include Bayesian updates and scenario analysis, supported by domain-specific insights and publicly available datasets.

1. **T20 Cricket World Cup 2024**:
   - Prediction: India has the highest probability of winning (21.4%).
   - Method: Analysis of historical performance, match conditions, and team strengths.

2. **China's GDP Growth (Q3 2024)**:
   - Prediction: 6.04% growth with a 75% probability.
   - Method: Factors include geopolitical tensions, technological innovations, and foreign investment policies.

3. **US Solar Energy (2025)**:
   - Prediction: Solar power will generate 16% of US energy, with 75% probability.
   - Method: Historical growth rates, federal investment policies, and deployment challenges considered.
